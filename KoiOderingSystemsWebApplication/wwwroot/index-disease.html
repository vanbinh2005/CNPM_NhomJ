        <p id="first-heading">
          ⚠️On this page, it is described in a simple explanation, so we recommend
          that you check in detail in specialized books for details of diseases
          and treatments.

        <h2>I. Early detection and diagnosis of fish diseases</h2>
        <p>
          It is said that the optimum water temperature for healthy carp is
          24~25°C. On the other hand, the water temperature at which carp-related
          bacteria tend to increase is 25~40°C, and it is considered that various
          types of bacteria live between the water temperatures according to the
          season. Parasites and bacteria are always present in any pond water and
          can parasitize any fish. As long as the water quality environment is
          good, it coexists with carp without harming them. However, when carp are
          stressed due to environmental degradation and other factors, their
          anti-disease mosquitoes immediately decline, parasites and bacteria
          multiply, and they infect carp and develop the disease. In addition,
          there are cases where bacteria adhere to the scale and develop when it
          is descaled due to rough handling or when it is traumatized by hitting a
          protrusion.
        </p>

      <div id="d1">
        <h2>II. Key points of observation</h2>
        <p>
          At the same time as observing the entire school of fish, we also take a
          good look at the individual fish from the following perspectives. If
          possible, it is important to carefully observe one carp every day to
          detect abnormalities at an early stage.

              <h3>1.The turbidity and color luster of the pond water</h3>
              <div>
                <p>The water that has become slightly green after the blue-green algae has
                  come out can be said to be favorable water for the health of the carp.
                </p> <br>
                <p> However, if there is too much turbidity, it will interfere with viewing
                  and observation.</p> <br>
                <p>On the other hand, water that is grayish, brownish, or
                  overcast is a water quality that is not suitable for carp growth.</p> <br>
                <p>We suspect that the capacity of the sedimentation tank and filtration tank
                  is insufficient, dirt, accumulation of sludge at the bottom of the pond,
                  lack of fresh water, lack of dissolved oxygen, too many breeds, and
                  excess feeding. Tests for pH, ammonia, nitrite, etc., to examine the

            <p>It has been confirmed that carp that have
              been treated for koi herpes virus disease by
              increasing temperatures can become carriers
              of the virus.
            </p> <br>
            <p class="colors">It is a complete misunderstanding that "Koi
              that have recovered naturally or have been
              treated with elevated temperature will recover
              completely and will not spread the disease to
              other koi."
            </p> <br>
            <p>Although KHV continues to live in the bodies
              of such carp, they appear healthy and do not
              show any symptoms of the disease, and
              therefore there is a possibility that they may
              become a source of infection spread through
              distribution and movement, such as through
              sales, temporary keeping, and exhibitions.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Koi that have recovered naturally or been
              treated with elevated temperature can
              become KHV carriers and become a source

            It is difficult to see what is inside the gills from the outside, but it
            is possible to infer that there is something wrong with the gills from
            the way the gill covers move. Additionally, abnormalities in the shape
            of the gill cover can be seen from the outside.

            When a fish dies, we check the gills, mucous membranes, and appearance.
            However, since the gills discolor within an hour of death, we examine
            fish just before they die.

          <h3>6. How to check for disease in individual fish</h3>

          <p>
            Symptoms of fish disease vary depending on whether it is in the early,
            middle or late stages. Early stages are easiest to cure, but in later
            stages the condition is already severe, and even if it does heal, most
            carp will have scars that make them unworthy of viewing.
          </p>
          <h4>a. Abnormalities on the body surface</h4>
          <p>
            There are many different abnormalities that can appear on the surface of
            the body, and people with microscopes can take a sample of mucus from
            the surface of the body and examine it. Start with a low magnification
            microscope and work your way up to higher magnifications.
          </p>
          <h4>b. Fin abnormalities</h4>
          <p>
            Check the papillae and pelvic fins for congestion, i.e., the presence of
            red streaks.
          </p>
          <h4>c. Gill abnormalities</h4>
          <p>
            Open the gills and observe. If there is no abnormality in the mucus on
            the body surface, two or three gills are removed and examined under a
            microscope. During the procedure, you will be given a light anesthetic.
            However, the gills of a dead fish will turn white within about an hour.
            Of course, even if we examine the fish after it has discolored, we
            cannot determine the cause of death.
          </p>
          <h4>d. Internal organ abnormalities</h4>
          <p>
            People who have dissected healthy fish and understand the normal
            condition of their internal organs will dissect them and check for any
            abnormalities in the internal organs. If you don't have much experience
            with dissections, try dissecting an unwanted healthy fish along with the
            reef fish and comparing the results.

      </div>
      <div id="d1">
        <h2>IV. First aid</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on the fish disease, it may be necessary to thoroughly
          disinfect the affected pond, including immediately discarding or
          isolating the fish. </p> <br>
        <p>
          There are some diseases for which there is no
          established treatment because the cause is unknown. If only one or two
          fish are abnormal and the others are doing fine, pick out the sick fish
          and separate them, then diagnose the disease and treat it accordingly. </p><br>
        <p>
          However, since many fish diseases are contagious, although the rate of
          spread may vary, it is preferable to treat the entire pond if possible.

                <p>a.4. While stopping the supply of
                  new water, add 25cc of formalin and 0.5g of Mazoten powder per ton of
                  water and circulate. Be sure to aerate thoroughly. </p><br>

                formalin has completely disappeared, add 6 kg of salt and 50 g of

                  water again and add about 4 kg of salt per ton of water. Since the old
                  water contains 2 kg of salt, the total amount is 6 kg per ton.</p> <br>

                  water immediately, and let the water temperature adjust before returning

            <p>When lifting the Nishikigoi with a net, if they
