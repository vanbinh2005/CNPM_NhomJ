                            <p>The water temperature 25℃ is the best condition for feeding.</p>
                            <p>Nishikigoi goes on fast for about half a year during over-wintering. Do not feed them when water temperature is below 10℃ to prevent from digestion problems.</p>
                            <p>Need a lot of oxygen for healthy digestion.                            </p>
                            <p>To help digestion and absorbing ability, soften by soaking any hard food in water before feeding.</p>
                            <p>It is recommended to feed in several batches, in such a volume as eaten up within 5 or 10 minutes.</p>
                            <p>Too much feeding brings about diarrhea state and floating dirt, a sign of digestion problem and ill health. Lessen the food quantity.</p>

                            <p>Tank installation site</p>
                            <p>Select solid and level or flat foundation site.</p>
                            <p>The site within the reach of water-supply hose is favorable.</p>
                            <p>The site free from direct sun-shine, rain, snow and etc.</p>
                            <p>Avoid such places where people come and go very often or may be frightened by door-sounds.</p>
                            <p>Cover the tank to prevent the carp from jumping out or being attacked by cats or birds.</p>

                                <p>The higher quality filtration device is recommended for installation, due to limited tank capacity that contains smaller volume of water allowing easy deterioration.</p>
                                <p>Two units installation is advisable.</p>
                                <p>Spread clean pebbles (size 0.5 ~ 1.0 cm) to cover the bottom of the tank with thickness of 3 ~ 5cm high.</p>
                                <p>Pebbles are helpful for filtration, and further serve to firmly fix decoration stones inside.</p>
                                <p>Coat the outside of glass tanks (rear, right and left sides) with blue or black back-screen for lightproof, thus helping the carps feel easy and look much beautiful.</p>

                                <p>In case of a water tank, “Shime-gai” is generally prefered.</p>
                                <p>Too much feeding sometimes causes blockage of the filtration device, resulting in deterioration of water quality in no time.</p>
                                <p>Periodical cleaning and water-change.</p>
                                <p>When the filtration device becomes dirty, run the water from upside over the device to clean lightly.</p>
                                <p>Even if raised in a tank, it is recommended to clean the tank keeping carps in the water as they were.</p>
                                <p>Take bigger stones only out of the container and stir up the pebbles and/or gravels to float dirt or foreign particles in the water.</p>
                                <p>After a while, filtration device works to suck the dirt or particles. Then, wash out the device to clean up.</p>

                            <p>Generally, it would be ideal if bio-filtration area is 1/3 of water volume of a pond.</p>
                            <p>For the filtering medium required, secure, at least, the volume nearly equal to 10% ~15% of pond water volume..</p>
                            <p>In case water volume is only 5-tons, installation of the bigger size of 10-ton use is recommended. That will help reduce the burden of the device.</p>

                            <p>Then, let the pond water into the vinyl bag about 1/2 filled to mix water.</p>

                            <p>After that, release Nishikigoi into the pond.</p>
                            <p>If you have a “Detached Facilities”, recommend “Salt water bathing”</p>

                            <p>Do not feed while Salt water bathing.</p>
                            <p>*Producers or traders usually carry out this salt bathing without fail, even if Koi’s displacement is made in the same facilities.</p>
                            <p>Advisable to effect salt-bathing whenever changes of circumstances for Koi.</p>
                            <p>Release into water tank</p>
                            <p>Replace water and Koi from vinyl-bag into a basin or a tub, then add the tank water in a volume about half of the bag water to mix.</p>
                            <p>Repeat this procedure several times. Take time till water temperature becomes equal.</p>
                            <p>Then release Koi only into the mixed water.</p>
